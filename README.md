# UQCS CodeJam

This repo is an assembly of my solutions to the UQCS CodeJam problems.

The [UQ Computing Society CodeJam](https://uqcs.org/competitions/) is an annual competition that challenges students to compete in completing a series of programming challenges. The chalenges can vary in scope, but will typically test the application of various data structures and algorithms. The challenge is open in terms of which language can be used.
